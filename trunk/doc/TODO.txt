Big picture TODO list, separate from the "// TODO"s in the code

* allow for a different mapping of (x,y) -> actual pixels
* edit the ant buildfile so that the code can be compiled for 1.5 anywhere
* show this to Dr. Bars, Dr. Bickers
* make time dilation more "automatic" so that each object doesn't have to figure it out on its own
  -- possible way of implementing: have PhysObj.update() just call timeIncrement(number) which
     is overridden in all the subclasses, e.g.
     
     public void timeIncrement(double time) {
       clockDegrees += time*CLOCK_SPEED; 
     }
     
     The argument will be determined by gamma. The subclasses never have to call gamma()
